I've been learning a lot over the past two months while setting up my first company [Rates and Agents](https://ratesandagents.com). I think my journey and others similar to mine should be documented so that people can see where I started at and compare that to where I end up.

I'm planning on updating this blog whenever possible and keeping the content pretty technical in nature. The info will concentrate on what I learn along the way. This will (probably) be concerned with business or programming or any other related processes that involve getting a startup up and running.
